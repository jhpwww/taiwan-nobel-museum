 * Bend the plinth labels onto the drum.
 *
 * The drum is a cylinder, and flat type laid across it reads as a sticker.
 * So each character is turned to the surface: rotated about Y by the angle
 * its own position subtends, and pushed back by how far the surface falls
 * away there. The browser's perspective does the rest — the foreshortening
 * at the ends and the slight loss of size with depth are what sell it, and
 * neither is drawn by hand.
 *
 * The angle is x / R — arc length — and not asin(x / R). That is the
 * difference between wrapping the label round the cylinder and projecting it
 * onto one, and it is the whole of what was wrong with 生理學或醫學.
 *
 * Projecting leaves each character where the layout put it and shrinks it
 * about its own centre. Two neighbours therefore both pull away from the
 * line between them, and a gap opens — w(1 − (cos θᵢ + cos θᵢ₊₁)/2) wide,
 * which at the ends of a six-character name is a fifth of a character. The
 * label stopped reading as a curve and started reading as squashed letters
 * with holes between them, worst exactly where the name is longest.
 *
 * Wrapping by arc length puts the right-hand edge of one character and the
 * left-hand edge of the next at the same arc position — but only if the
 * character is moved to where that arc position projects. Turning it in
 * place is not enough: the layout puts its centre at the arc length rθ and
 * the cylinder puts it at the chord r·sin θ, and the difference is exactly
 * the gap. So each character is also slid inward by r·sin θ − rθ, which is
 * three pixels at the ends of the longest name and nothing in the middle.
 * The line contracts by that much — 6% at this width, which is what a label
 * wrapped round a drum actually does — and it is continuous.
 *
 * The radius is measured off the model: at the label's height the drum draws
 * 144px across a 190px frame.
 *
 * How much of that depth reads as height is NOT a separate figure, and
 * treating it as one is what bent 生理學或醫學 the wrong amount. It was a
 * guessed 8° of camera tilt, which lifted the outer characters 2.2px while
 * the gold rings — drawn on the very same drum, from measured constants —
 * rise only 1.35px across the same span. The line therefore sat on a tighter
 * cylinder than the drum it is cut into, bowed two thirds too hard, and
 * kinked at the ends where the foreshortening is strongest.
 *
 * So it comes from the rings instead. A horizontal circle at height y draws
 * as an ellipse b deep, and b/R is exactly how much a unit of depth rises on
 * screen. Same two constants, same drum, by construction rather than by
 * agreement.
 *
 * They were briefly set to 0.30 and 18° on the belief that the true figures
 * were invisible. They were not invisible; they were not being applied at all,
 * because the spans this script creates never carry Astro's scope attribute
 * and so never got `display: inline-block` — and transform does nothing to a
 * non-replaced inline element. Tune against the rendered width, never against
 * the style string.
 *
 * Progressive: if this never runs, the labels are simply flat.
