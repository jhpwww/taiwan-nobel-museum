/**
 * check-glass.mjs — is the bright museum's home page still readable over its
 * own hall?
 *
 * The home page has no ground. The hall is fixed for the whole document and
 * the page is read in front of it, so what is behind any given word is a
 * photograph of a rotunda — white marble at one end of its range and a wall of
 * thirty-six dark screens at the other. Nothing in check-contrast.mjs can
 * speak to that: those tools compare tokens, and no token describes a room.
 *
 * So this measures the page as rendered. It hides the type and the pictures,
 * walks every element that carries text, and finds the darkest pixel actually
 * underneath each one — its real ground — then reports the worst.
 *
 * It runs at two device pixel ratios on purpose. A backdrop-filter is a GPU
 * texture and a texture may not exceed 8192px: an earlier version of this page
 * frosted its whole 3197px column, which is fine at ratio 2 and 9591px at
 * ratio 3. Chromium does not warn, does not fall back, and simply stops
 * filtering — so the bug was invisible on every desktop and present on most
 * phones. Panes are small now; ratio 3 is here to keep it that way.
 *
 *     node scripts/check-glass.mjs            # needs the bright dev server
 *     URL=https://... node scripts/check-glass.mjs
 *
 * Exits non-zero if any ground falls under WCAG AA for the text on it.
