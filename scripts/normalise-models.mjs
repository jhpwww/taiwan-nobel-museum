 * normalise-models.mjs — make six models from six authors sit alike.

 * The sources arrive at wildly different scales (the flask is 19 units tall,
 * the coin 0.03 across, the dove 96) and with their pivots anywhere. Dropped
 * into identical <model-viewer> frames they would each need hand-tuned camera
 * settings, and any later swap would need them again.
 *
 * So each model is rewritten once, here: pruned, re-centred on its own
 * bounding box, and scaled so its longest axis is exactly 1 unit. After this
 * every icon takes the same camera and the same framing, and swapping a model
 * is a one-line change to PICKS in fetch-models.py.
 *
 * ORIENT holds the only per-model judgement — a rotation where the source's
 * idea of "up" or "front" is not ours. Values were set by looking at the
 * rendered result, not guessed.

/**
 * A cage the size of the canonical box, so all six frame alike.
 *
 * model-viewer will not simply take the camera it is given: it clamps the
 * orbit radius and the field of view against the model's own bounds so the
 * thing always fits, and a short piece therefore comes out drawn larger. The
 * measured effect was a field of view of 30.0° to 32.0° across the six and
 * drums between 117 and 140 pixels wide, from geometry that is identical in
 * every file. Pinning min/max-camera-orbit fixes the radius; nothing pins the
 * field of view. So the bounds themselves are made equal, with one triangle
 * spanning the box — two distinct corners and a repeat — which every bounding
 * box must contain.
 *
 * It carries a fully transparent material, and that is not belt and braces.
 * The triangle is degenerate as authored and should rasterise to nothing, but
 * quantization snaps its corners to the nearest grid point and the repeated one
 * does not always land where its twin does. What comes out is a sliver with
 * real area, in the default white, drawn straight across the piece: a hairline
 * slit through the gold cap of the chemistry award and the physics one beside
 * it, which read as the models themselves being broken.
