/**
 * build-base-rings.mjs — cut the three gold bands into the drum itself.
 *
 * They were drawn by the page: three SVG arcs laid over the model, their depth
 * worked out from two constants measured off the drum's own ellipses. That is
 * a good approximation and it was wrong three times, for three different
 * reasons — the arcs sagged less than the base they were on, then more, and
 * the numbers only ever held at the one frame aspect they were measured at.
 * A band that is part of the object cannot disagree with it: it turns with the
 * turntable, it is lit by the same light, and its perspective is whatever the
 * camera says it is.
 *
 * The source drum is not touched. This reads assets-src/models/_base.glb and
 * writes _base-ringed.glb beside it; the pipeline consumes the ringed one.
 *
 *     node scripts/build-base-rings.mjs
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Geometry
 *
 * Each band is a strip of the cylinder's own surface, a whisker proud of it:
 * two rings of vertices at h ± HALF, at radius R + PROUD, joined into quads.
 * Radially outward normals, so it catches the light as the marble beside it
 * does rather than as a flat decal would.
 *
 * The heights are computed through the pipeline rather than measured off a
 * screenshot, because there are three transforms between here and the frame
 * and a figure read off the render has all three baked into it — which is how
 * the first attempt landed a whole step low, trimmed twice.
 *
 * The chain, in order: normalise-models wraps the drum in [1, 0.8, 1] with a
 * lift of 0.0356 to take a fifth off its foot, so y_post = 0.8·y + 0.0356;
 * the assembly is then scaled by 1/(0.178 + 0.525 − 0.0356) = 1.4984 and slid
 * to put the drum's foot on the cage's floor, so cage = 1.4984·y_post −
 * 0.55334; and the cage's ±0.5 fills the model's drawn height in the frame.
 * Put together, the middle band has to sit at 0.13806 for the device on the
 * plinth to be centred on it, and a step of 0.016631 is the quarter of the
 * device's height the drawn version used.
 *
 * The label is positioned to the bands now, not the other way round — the drum
 * is the object and the type is the annotation.
 *
 * And each band stops short of the front, so the device sits in a clearing
 * rather than on a line. 17.5° each side of centre is the 140% of the device's
 * width that the drawn version used, at the size the hall draws it.
 *
 * "The front" is the camera's, not the model's. Every hall, the gallery pages
 * and the poster renderer look at these from camera-orbit 35deg, so the point
 * of the drum facing the viewer — and therefore the point the device is drawn
 * over, since the device is centred in the frame — is the one at 35° round the
 * axis, not the one at zero. Centring the clearing on the model's +Z put it a
 * third of a turn to the left of the device, with the bands running straight
 * behind it. FRONT below must track CAMERA in HallBright.astro,
 * GalleryPage.astro, LecturePage.astro, HallModels.astro and
 * render-posters.mjs; they all carry the same '35deg 98deg 1.55m'.
